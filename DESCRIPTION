Description: lagR computes the lagged version of a time series or generic vector by shifting the values back by a given number of observations. The function either 1) replaces the lagged observations with NaNs or the inputs of your choice (e.g., random values from a distribution) or 2) wraps the last n values to the front or back of the time seriesâ€“as determined by the specified lag value and sign. This package avoids rare errors that are occasionally caused by the stats::lag package, which is a generic function that adds a tsp attribute via hasTsp to the time series; lagR avoids this issue by treating all inputs and outputs as plain vectors. It also provides more functionality than TSA::zlag by allowing users to wrap their time series or replace missing lagged values in one function.
