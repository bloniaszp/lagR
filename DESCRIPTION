Description: lagR computes the lagged version of a time series or generic vector by shifting the values back by a given number of observations. It then can either 1) replace the lagged observations with an NaN or the inputs of your choice (e.g., random values from a distribution) or 2) wrap the last n values to the front of the time seriesâ€“as determined by the desired lag value. This package avoids the specific errors occasionally caused by misuse of the stats::lag package, which is a generic function that adds a tsp attribute via hasTsp to the time series by treating all inputs and outputs as plain vectors. It also provides more functionality than TSA::zlag by allowing users to wrap their time series or replace missing lagged values in one function.
